# UnclaimedProperties
Requested the https://claimittexas.org database for unclaimed properties to analyze and visualize the data

Problems:
1. There aren't labels for each "column" in the txt file. 
2. The file isn't organized to make it easy for python pandas to digest as a dataframe (i.e. no commas)
3. Not every field (column) is filled out for each entry (row)
